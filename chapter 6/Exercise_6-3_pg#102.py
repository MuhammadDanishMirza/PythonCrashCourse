    "Algorithm" : "An algorithm is a step-by-step set of instructions or a set of rules to follow to complete a task or solve a particular problem. In programming, algorithms are fundamental to designing efficient and effective solutions.",
    "Variable"  : "A variable is a symbolic name or identifier associated with a storage location (memory address) that holds data in a program. Variables can store different types of information and can be manipulated during the program's execution.",
    "Function"  : "A variable is a symbolic name or identifier associated with a storage location (memory address) that holds data in a program. Variables can store different types of information and can be manipulated during the program's execution.",
    "Syntax"    : "Syntax refers to the set of rules that dictate how programs written in a programming language should be structured. It defines the correct combinations of symbols, keywords, and other elements that form valid and executable code.",
    "Debugging" : "Debugging is the process of identifying and fixing errors, or bugs, in a program. Programmers use debugging techniques and tools to locate and resolve issues in their code, ensuring that the program functions as intended.",
